# README
Welcome to my first attempt at learning Ruby on Rails.

You can see a website I've created with a little whimsy where you're able to sign up (not very securely as this is just a project)
as a staff member, and then make modifications to the cat database with a variety of information for each cat. 

I plan to additionally add SQL support to handle very large datasets and potentially use RNN and image classification AI models 
so you can type in a query for the type of cat you'd like and based on the SQL data, you will be recommended a cat based on the desired 
traits.
